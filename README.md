# Tetris-Clone
A simple Tetris clone.
## Running
It will work fine on Windows, but I did not make a version for MacOS or any Unix-Like systems. You can recompile with the source code after I release it. For Windows users, unzip the folder and run the program.
## License and Usage
Most of the assets are made by me, except for the font which I think has some kind of license. It can be found here: https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html. Besides the font, feel free to use this for personal and commercial use!
## Bugs
There are a few bugs which I think I fixed. Still, if you want to help, feel free to sift through my mound of spaghetti code!
